# Parser documentation

Like every other compilers, Chirp has a parser. This *obviously* is the documentation for that parser. You might want to check out the parse tree documentation too.

# Example

> This exemple is with the rewritten parser, but it isn't written yet. lmao

In this simple example we will see how the parser should behave during parsing.

```chirp
int: a = 123
```

First the string will be separated in words, inside a vector. All spaces will be removed.
