Chirp Website
This is the official website for the Chirp Programming Language and it's documentation. Most of the code for the first version was written by ``@Dmunch04``.

This website purpose is to inform people about the Chirp Programming Language and it's documentation.



The reason this file is a .txt and not a .md, is because if it were .md it would be loaded in the website.
